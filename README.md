# DroolsLogistics
This is an example Drools ruleset for the assignment in [Droolscours](https://github.com/kiegroup/droolscourse/tree/master/cost-calculation).

Basically, we have a simple BMPN2 process having four separate rule steps ("rule groups"). 

In the JUnit test, we load the facts given in the assignment, and start the process.

Intermediate and final results are in the POJO class TransportationCosts.
